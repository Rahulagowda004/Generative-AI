# 🤖 AI Models and Data Processing Repository

In this repository, I have implemented various **AI models** and **data processing techniques**, including **NLP**, **generative models**, and other cutting-edge tools. The main areas of focus include:

### 🧠 **NLP and Data Processing**
- **Data Ingestion** 📥: Implemented methods for efficiently ingesting and processing raw data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Tokenization** 🔠: Applied tokenization techniques to break down text into meaningful units for NLP tasks.
- **Lemmatization** 🦋: Used lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms, improving text analysis.
- **Stopword Removal** 🚫: Removed common stopwords from text data to enhance model performance in NLP tasks.

### 🤖 **Generative Models**
- **Business News Generation** 📰: Developed a model specifically for generating **business news articles** based on various inputs and contexts.
- **Text Generation** 📝: Created a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text using advanced transformer-based architectures.
- **Image Generation** 🖼️: Implemented an AI model capable of generating images based on input parameters.
- **Audio Generation** 🎶: Built a model that generates **audio content** using data-driven techniques.

### ⚡ **Transformer Models**
- **Few-Shot Generalization** 📚: Applied few-shot learning to enhance model performance on new, unseen data with minimal examples.
- **Zero-Shot Text Generation** 🛠️: Utilized zero-shot learning methods to generate text without needing task-specific training.

### 📚 **Notebooks and Tools**
The repository includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate these techniques:
- **Tokenization.ipynb** 🔠: For text tokenization and preprocessing.
- **Lemmatization.ipynb** 🦋: For lemmatization techniques.
- **Stopwords.ipynb** 🚫: For removing stopwords from text.
- **Business News Generator** 📰: For generating business-related content.
- **Text Generator** 📝: For generating text based on different inputs.
- **Image Generator** 🖼️: For generating images using AI models.
- **Audio Generator** 🎶: For generating audio files from text.
